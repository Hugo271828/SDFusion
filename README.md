SDFusion is a diffusion-based 3D shape generator. It enables various applications. (left) SDFusion can generate 3D shapes conditioned on different input modalities, including partial shapes, images, and text. SDFusion can even jointly handle multiple conditioning modalities while controlling the strength for each of them. (right) We showcase an application where we leverage pretrained 2D models to texture 3D shapes generated by SDFusion. We also use a 3D-printer to print out the generated shapes of SDFusion.
